# ClassClock Manuals

This repository contains the source code of various ClassClock manuals. Each one is written in LaTeX and is contained in its own folder along with any supplementary materials needed.

## Generating

Generating the PDF's *should* be as easy as running `build.sh`. Dependencies *should* just be the `latexmk` tool and the LaTeX packages at the top of the `*.tex` files.

# ClassClock Manuals

This repository contains various ClassClock manuals. Each one has its own folder containing the LaTeX source code along with any supplementary materials (such as images).

These manuals were largely inspired by/adapted from a "mini training manual" assignment from a Professional Communications class and are split into different topics for different stakeholders:

- **Admin Interface User Training Manual** - This manual is intended to provide an overview of the basic features and operation of the ClassClock Admin Interface, including adding, removing, and updating bell schedules.

## Generating

Generating the PDF's *should* be as easy as running `build.sh`. Dependencies *should* just be the `latexmk` tool and the LaTeX packages at the top of the `*.tex` files.
